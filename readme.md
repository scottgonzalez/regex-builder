# RegexBuilder

A tool for generating regular expressions.

## Overview

RegexBuilder allows you to define complex regular expressions in terms of smaller
rules. Those rules can be controlled by options, which can change the definition
of the rules. The output can then be generated in a variety of flavors in order
to support the varying syntaxes across programming languages.
